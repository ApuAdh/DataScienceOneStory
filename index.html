            <h2>Looking at the graph you might think that Arceus absolutely dogwater Infernape.
                But there is one crucial detail we are missing. Infernape is a <a href="https://pokemondb.net/type/fighting" class="fighting" target="_blank">fighting</a> type pokem-
                on, whereas Arceus is a <a href="https://pokemondb.net/type/normal" target="_blank" class="normal">normal</a> type pokemon. Which means if Infernape uses the move
                <a href="https://pokemondb.net/move/close-combat" class="fighting" target="_blank">"Close Combat"</a>, which has a base damamge of 120 and is a fighting type move so the
                damage is multiplied by two when it hits Arcues. Then Infernape can use the held item,

            <h2>Well that might be a little confusing so let's slow down a bit. In Pokemon there isn't a one
                "Strongest Pokemon". There are many multiple things that can have an effect on a battle. In the
                previous paragraph we talked about pokemon <a href="https://pokemondb.net/type" target="_blank" class="types">types</a> and <a href="https://pokemondb.net/item/all" class="types" target="_blank">held items</a>. There are multiple different
                held items that exist in pokemon. They all have a cool effect on the battlefield, the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Choice_Scarf" class="choice_scarf" target="_blank">Choice Scarf</a>
                locks your pokemon to be able to only use one move but increases the speed stat by 1.5X

            <h2>Altough <a href="https://pokemondb.net/item/all" class="types" target="_blank">held items</a> play a crucial role in pokemon battles,
            the biggest thing that affects a fight between two pokemon is their <a href="https://pokemondb.net/type" target="_blank" class="types">type.</a>
            Let's say you are having a pokemon battle between your friends, they have a <a href="https://pokemondb.net/type/water" target="_blank" class="choice_scarf">water</a> type
            pokeomn and you have a <a href="https://pokemondb.net/type/grass" target="_blank" class="grass">grass</a> type pokemon. You might think you have the advantage here,

            So let's get you the strongest pokemon for every type so that the next time you battle your friends, you destroy them mercilessly and secure those bragging rights.

If you want to check my data, the whole website is literally my data. Then I wrote some python functions that turned every single pokemon into an object with their different stats and properties being classes. I also created a custom property known as "preferred attack"(the higher one out of the two stats). Then I graphed every pokemon in two Scatterplots one to find their offensive capabilites and defensive capabilites. I also had to learn a couple of Algebra 2 topics to maximize functionality in my website(make the graphs load 0.2seconds faster) and more geometry to learn how to do my CSS animations. All the graphs are interactive, the first graph compares the preferred attack and speed stat and the second graph compares the two defense stats. I also had a third interactive graph where I compared Infernape with Arceus</h4>
